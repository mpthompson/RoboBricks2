# RoboBricks2 Based Balancing Robot

Balancing robot implementation based on RoboBricks2 compatible components.

The software here runs on custom RoboBricks2 modules created by Mike Thompson.
These modules are similar to Wayne Gramlich's RoboBricks2 modules, but utilize
Atmel based MCUs rather than MicroChip based MCUs.  

For information on RoboBricks2, see:
